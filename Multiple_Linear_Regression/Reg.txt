

MIltiple linear regression is a extended version of the SimpleLinear Regression.

here the Features are more , so the weights associated with the features are  more for that we use Matrix representation to minimize the operation.
this Regression can be solved by Matrix operation.

y=w0+w1x1+w2x2+w3x3.....wnxn

w0->intercept
w1,w2,w3..wn->coefficients
W is a matrix that cointains intercept+coeffficients

ultimate goal is to find the Matrix M .
